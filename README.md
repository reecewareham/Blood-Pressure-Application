# Blood-Pressure-Application
A blood pressure application made as part of my final year project at Sheffield Hallam University.

The goal of this project was to create a mobile application for Android that allows users to measure and track their blood pressure and heart rate.
This goal of this project was achieved and the final project can be seen in this repository.

This project was made using a combination of Jetpack Compose to create the user interface and Google Firebase to create the backend systems. All the code is written in Kotlin.

## How to Install

1. Make sure you have Android Studio installed on your device.
2. Pull the Git repository into Android Studio and open the project.
3. Choose the device you want to install and load the application on using the Device Manager in Android Studio. If the device is physical, you must set the device into developer mode and enable USB Debugging to install.
4. Press run and the app will install on the device you selected.

Alternatively, you can install the application directly using the APK that is supplied in this repository. Make sure Install from Unknown Sources is enabled or it will not install.
